      Hi, I'm Lucas
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Lucas Jansen and I'm an embedded software engineer from Cork, Ireland.
      I currently work on bare-metal software for system-level validation at Qualcomm.

      Most of my time programming is spent writing embedded code in C, C++, and Assembly;
        primarily tests for hardware validation at Qualcomm.
      I do also have experience writing application code,
        both as part of my work and for personal projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      For scripting and automation tasks I use Python extensively,
        especially when the task gets too complicated for a simple shell script.
      I also learned Rust, mainly out of my own curiosity,
        although I'm not quite as experienced in that as the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also dabbled in several other languages over the years,
        including Ruby, Bash, JavaScript, Lua, PHP, and Matlab.
